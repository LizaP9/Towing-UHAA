# Towing UHAA

This project focuses on the development of a **Towing Unmanned High Altitude Airship (UHAA)** as part of a course in Systems Engineering. The towing airship is designed to return service UHAAs, which operate as mobile base stations at altitudes around 20 km, back to their starting points. The system helps form closed-loop routes and maintain continuous communication networks with minimal energy consumption.

## Task Description
For a detailed description of the project, please refer to the file [**Systems Engineering Project 2023-V5**](./Systems%20Engineering%20Project%202023-V5.pdf).

## Key Achievements
- **Prototype Development:** Created a functional scaled-down model, testing key aspects such as buoyancy, propulsion, and towing mechanisms.
- **Innovative Design Solutions:** Introduced systems for buoyancy control, energy management, and towing operations.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Addressed critical risks including propulsion system failure and structural integrity through expert involvement and rigorous testing.

## Technical Details
- **Structural Design:** Focused on optimizing the main frame, propulsion, and towing systems to ensure stability and control.
- **Subsystem Testing:** Developed prototypes for the balloon structure, electronics, and towing mechanism, ensuring reliability and performance.
- **Robust Towing System:** A mechanism that allows for secure attachment to the service UHAAs.
- **Simulation:** Simulated the airshipâ€™s trajectory and aerodynamic drag to fine-tune the propulsion system and energy efficiency.
