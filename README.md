# Towing UHAA

This project focuses on the development of a **Towing Unmanned High Altitude Airship (UHAA)** as part of a course in Systems Engineering. The towing airship is designed to return service UHAAs, which operate as mobile base stations at altitudes around 20 km, back to their starting points. The system helps form closed-loop routes and maintain efficient communication networks with minimal energy consumption.

## Key Features:
- Structural design and propulsion systems for towing.
- Tethering mechanisms to adjust flight paths.
- Prototype development for both physical and virtual testing.
- Risk analysis and compliance with aviation regulations.
